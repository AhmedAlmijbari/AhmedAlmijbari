### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
Hi! I'm **Ahmed**. I graduated from the Elite MSc program in Neuroengineering at TU Munich. Through my hard work and dedication, I have won two scholarships and graduated with an honour and research excellence certificate from the elite network of Bavaria. 

My passion lies in using machine learning and data science to understand the brain and enhance human lives. 

As a research assistant at the Klinikum rechts der Isar and TU Munich, I used fMRI data to explore the neural dynamics of the brain and find meaningful patterns in brain activity. I implemented large-scale data science methods to analyse brain images of 24 subjects containing 160M time series signals and 20+ GB of data.

I'm a lifelong learner who loves STEM education, reading books, and using technology for positive change. I enjoy writing, teaching, football, music and discovering new cultures.

Let's talk if you'd like to use computational and engineering solutions for a positive impact. Feel free to contact me at ahmed.almijbari@tum.de or visit my website: https://ahmedalmijbari.github.io.

Competencies: Neuroengineering, Biomedical Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Analysis, Data Processing, Data Visualisation, Signal Processing, Image Processing, Numerical Methods, Brain-computer Interface (BCI), Neuroprosthetics, Biomedical AI Algorithms, Computational Engineering, Biomedical Computing, Scientific Computing, Neuroimaging, Software Engineering, Programming in Python and Matlab.
