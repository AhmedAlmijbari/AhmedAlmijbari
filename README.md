## 🌟 About Me

Hey there! I'm Ahmed Almijbari, a passionate neuroengineering graduate from the Elite MSc program at **TU Munich**. My journey has been marked by dedication, leading to the honour of receiving two scholarships and graduating with excellence from the Elite Network of Bavaria.

## 🚀 Experience

As a research assistant at **Klinikum rechts der Isar** and **TU Munich**, I've used fMRI data to explore the neural dynamics of the brain and find meaningful patterns in brain activity. I implemented and developed large-scale data science tools to analyse and understand brain images of 24 subjects containing 160M time series signals and 20+ GB of data.
